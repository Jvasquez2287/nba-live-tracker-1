## Technical Implementation Details

### Box Score Endpoint Algorithm
```typescript
1. Fetch game from scoreboard by gameId
2. Extract team data (IDs, names, tricodes, scores)
3. For each team's game leaders:
   - Map personId → player stats
   - Extract: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks
   - Aggregate into team player array
4. Calculate team totals
5. Return formatted box score JSON
```

### Key Moments Detection Algorithm
```typescript
1. Fetch play-by-play data for game
2. Iterate through plays chronologically
3. Track home vs away team lead status
4. Detect changes when:
   - Lead team switches (lead change)
   - Score differential crosses 3-point threshold (clutch moment)
5. Store moment metadata: type, period, clock, score
6. Return last 10 moments
```

### Win Probability Algorithm
```typescript
1. Get current game state
2. Calculate base probability from team records:
   - homeProb = wins / (wins + losses)
   - awayProb = wins / (wins + losses)
3. Add home court advantage (+3%)
4. If game in progress:
   - Calculate score-based probability = homeScore / totalScore
   - Weight: 70% current score + 30% historical
5. Clamp result to [0.01, 0.99]
6. Return with game context (score, period, clock)
```

### Season Leaders Algorithm
```typescript
1. Collect all players from all today's games
2. Aggregate stats for each player:
   - Sum: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks
   - Count: games played
3. Calculate averages: stat_total / games_played
4. Sort by requested stat (descending)
5. Return top N with ranking and averages
```

## Known Limitations

### Data Scope
- **Current Implementation**: Only today's games from NBA API
- **Why**: Intentional design using live NBA API (`cdn.nba.com`)
- **Alternative**: Could integrate database for historical storage

### Advanced Features Not Implemented
- AI-powered insights (requires Groq API key)
- Long-term statistical trends (needs historical database)
- Predictive modeling (current: simple heuristics)

### Future Enhancements
1. Database integration for historical data persistence
2. Groq AI integration for intelligent insights
3. Advanced predictive algorithms
4. Custom stat calculations
5. User preference tracking
